A Special Message:

A while ago, I rescued a baby bird that had fallen from its nest. It was on the verge of dying, but I took it in and cared for it. Sadly, due to an unfortunate accident, the bird later passed away. This experience made me realize that birds thrive best in their natural environment. However, if we can provide them with food, water, and shelter, we can help prevent such tragedies from happening again.

In memory of my beloved pet bird Pappu, I have launched this course completely free. Every part of this course—including PPTs, notes, code, assets, and files—will be freely accessible to everyone.

All earnings or donations generated through this course will go entirely towards providing food, water, and shelter for birds in need. This initiative is my tribute to Pappu, and a small step toward creating a safer world for birds.
